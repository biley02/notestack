# Notestack

  Notes and Study Material Serving Platform.
  
# Idea

The idea sparked when I and my freinds were in our first semester of the BTech. degree persuing from NIT Silchar in CSE.

We had our exams approaching but we were unable to find reliable sources for notes and study materials. Either we have to ring up 
our CRs or the "topper" of our branch/class. 

Thus minds of Shashwat Priyadarshy, Rahul Jain and Biley Roy respectively cooked up this idea of notes serving platform and started working on. Now it is known as "Notestack".
